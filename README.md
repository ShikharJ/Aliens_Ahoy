# Aliens_Ahoy
A 2D Ship Shooting Game Built Using Pygame Library
Aliens Ahoy is my first ever Python 3.5.2 project built using the amazing Pygame Library. 
The motivation for this project came partly from my passion for core CS development and the ease of programming with the Python language.
The player is given the command of a ship, with the capability to fire a fixed amount of bullets. Each bullet can take down only a single enemy ship at once. The bullets must hit all of the invading aliens, to advance to the next level.
The player can move left or right with the help of the arrow keys, and fire bullets using the spacebar. The alien fleet drops down in only after traversing the screen width.
Each player is guven a total of three spaceships to spare, and a predetermined pause occurs at the devastation of the current ship.
The game uses dynamic settings, and as such, after the progression of each level of the game, the alien fleet speed changes by a certain predetermined amount to introduce more challenges into the game.
The game does not have an upper bound on the levels, i.e., the game currently does not have a fixed number of levels (a change which is expected to be implemented soon).
However, during each play, the high score is displayed on the screen, challenging different players to give their best performance, and emerge with the highest score.
The play button appears at the start and  at the end of a player's gameplay. Happy Gaming!
